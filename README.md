# Designing-an-SMTP-Mail-Server-Using-iRedMail
This repo demonstrates the complete design, deployment, and validation of a secure SMTP mail server using iRedMail on a cloud-based Linux VPS. The server supports encrypted email transmission, authenticated mail delivery, DNS-based email protection mechanisms, and successful end-to-end communication with external email providers such as Gmail.
